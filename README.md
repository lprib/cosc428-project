##Requirements:

* OpenCV 4.5.2
* NumPy 1.20
* matplotlib
* python 3.7+
* Linux (uses linux path strings, but this could be adapted)

##Project Structure:

* ./data/ - input data files used by python. Includes camera matrices, dial position files, video files, etc.
* ./outputs/ - various output data files generated by python
* ./pics/ - pictures of outputs (were used in report)

##Python Files:

* `control_detector_common.py` - common files used by both control angle detection algorithms
* `control_detector_contour_fit` - perform control angle detection using the contour linear regression fit algorihtm
	* if run as an executable module, it will show the algo working realtime from a video file
* `control_detector_hough_lines.py` - perform control angle detection using the hough lines averaging algorithm
	* if run as an executable module, it will show the algo working realtime from a video file
* `control_picker.py` - allows you to specify custom control locations on an image. press 'a' to start a rect, 'z' to finish it. 'q' to save to `./data/knobs.csv` and quit.
* `stats.py` and `stats2.py` - used to generate pgf plots and place them in the LaTeX report directory for direct importing.
* `transform_color_mark.py` - Performs fiducial matching and perspective transform on images. This is called automatically in `util.py` functions and (indirectly) when running `control_detector_*.py`
* `util.py` - many helper functions for running camera loops, generating test harnesses, and much more

##Quick Start:

If all dependencies are working, try `python3 control_detector_hough_lines.py`.
